#Wireless Sensor Network for Alcohol Detection
<h2>Overview</h2>
Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) play a crucial role in long-distance data collection and transmission. Each sensor node acts as a relay station, facilitating seamless communication within the network. This project leverages LoRaWAN technology, known for its low power consumption and extended data transmission range, to establish a WSN for alcohol detection.<br>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
Scalability: Easily scale the network without modifying existing sensors.<br>
LoRaWAN Technology: Enables long-range communication with low power consumption.<br>
Battery Efficiency: LoRa technology allows sensors to operate for up to 10 years without recharging or replacement.<br>
Rapid Deployment: Quick and cost-effective deployment over expansive sites.<br>
Cloud Integration: Data obtained from the network is updated to the cloud for easy access and monitoring.<br>
<h2>Components Used</h2>
LoRa Transceiver + ESP 8266 Module: Establishes communication within the WSN and updates data to the cloud.<br>
MQ3 Alcohol Sensor: Collects data from various samples for alcohol detection.<br>
<h2>Project Objectives</h2>
The primary goal of this project is to develop a Wireless Sensor Network for alcohol detection using an MQ3 gas sensor. The network communicates internally through LoRa transceivers and updates the obtained data to the cloud via an ESP 8266 module.<br>

<h2>Implementation</h2>
<<h3>IoT Integration</h3>
Our system employs an Internet of Things (IoT) approach to ensure real-time data monitoring. The ESP 8266 module is responsible for transmitting data collected from the MQ3 sensor to an online cloud platform. The cloud platform hosts a dynamic webpage where users can access and visualize real-time alcohol detection data.<br>
